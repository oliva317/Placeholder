I stumbled upon this idea when I was reading something on the court defense of, "My brain made me do it".
Free Will, according to the <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freewill/">&nbspStanford&nbspEncyclopedia&nbspof&nbspPhilosophy</a>, is 
"the canonical designator for a significant kind of control over oneâ€™s actions". While a bulk of neuroscience supports the idea that
free will is an illusion, it is not an easy idea to grasp. Many of us hold on the notion that free will exists. After all, who is making
my decisions? The free will debate typically falls in several catergories. The first category is the degree of free will that we hold ourselves
to believe we have. If we believe we have full free will, we believe to be part of the libertarianism camp. If we believe we do not have control,
we fall in the determinism camp. The last camp is compatibilism, which say that both free will and determism are compatible.

<p> 
Usually, a deciding factor on your belief of free will is the decision on the philosophy of the mind. If you believe that
<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/physicalism/">the mind and body are one in the same</a>,
you are in the physicalism corner. Otherwise, if you believe that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism">that the mind and body are distinct 
and separable</a> then you are in the dualism corner.
</p>

<p> 
How you view the mind is an important factor because if precedes how you behave and think. If you believe the mind and/or consciousness is the result of neurons firing,
you are less likely to believe in a soul. Otherwise, the dualism camp separates the mind from the body(i.e the brain) and gives it its own identity (e.g spirit, soul).
